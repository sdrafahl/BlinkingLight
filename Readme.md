# Blinking Light Demo For ATtiny85

To learn about embedded systems development I learned what tool chain is required to write, compile, and upload machine code a ATtiny85 microcontroller.

To upload the program I used AVRdude and the programmer is a Tiny AVR Programmer.

## Setup

1. First you need to plug in the Tiny AVR Programmer to a USB port with the micro controller connected to it.

2. Run make

```
make
```

Now the compiled code should have been burned onto the ROM of the microcontroller.
